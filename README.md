# E-commerce-Sales-Performance-Analysis-in-Python
This project involves performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data using Python. The primary goal is to uncover key sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance to provide actionable insights for business growth and optimization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `Diwali Sales Data.csv`, which contains transactional information from an e-commerce platform during the Diwali festive season.
Columns include: `User_ID`, `Cust_name`, `Product_ID`, `Gender`, `Age Group`, `Age`, `Marital_Status`, `State`, `Zone`, `Occupation`, `Product_Category`, `Orders`, `Amount`, `Status`, `unnamed1`.

## Key Objectives
-   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and irrelevant columns.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Analyze sales distribution by Gender.
    -   Identify top-performing Age Groups based on sales amount.
    -   Determine the top 10 states by total orders and sales amount.
    -   Investigate sales performance across different Marital Statuses.
    -   Uncover customer purchasing behavior based on Occupation.
    -   Analyze sales and order trends by Product Category.
-   **Derive Actionable Insights:** Provide conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
-   **Python:** Programming language for data analysis.
-   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
-   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
-   **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
-   **Seaborn:** For drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
-   **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for code execution and visualization.

## Analysis & Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations such as:
-   Bar plots showing sales by gender.
-   Bar plots illustrating sales amount by age group (and further segmented by gender).
-   Bar plots identifying top states by orders and total sales amount.
-   Bar plots breaking down sales by marital status.
-   Bar plots detailing sales by different occupations.
-   Bar plots demonstrating orders and sales amount for various product categories.

## Key Insights & Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the project concluded that:
-   Married women aged 26-35 years are the most significant buyers.
-   The top-performing states in terms of orders and sales amount are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
-   Customers from the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors are the most frequent purchasers.
-   The highest sales and orders are observed in the Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics & Gadgets categories.

These insights suggest focusing marketing efforts and product stocking on these segments to maximize sales during festive seasons like Diwali.
